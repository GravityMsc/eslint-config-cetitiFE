First of all, 

`npm install eslint-config-cetitife --save-dev`  

And you will install eslint,babel-eslint and three of plugins(react,jsx-ally,import) automaticly.  

In your .eslintrc file, 
````
{  
    "extends": "cetitife"  
}
````

PS: If you want to use in your editor eslint, please add `-g` while you install.  
    this package is an experimental version and it is not recommended to use now!
